# ** Note: (vsim-3813) Design is being optimized due to module recompilation...
# Support of the MGLS_LICENSE_FILE and LM_LICENSE_FILE licensing environment variables will be discontinued starting with the 2025.1 release. Please update to using the SALT_LICENSE_SERVER variable.
# Please contact Siemens EDA Customer Support (https://support.sw.siemens.com/) for assistance.
# ** Warning: (vopt-10587) Some optimizations are turned off because the +acc switch is in effect. This will cause your simulation to run slowly. Please use -access/-debug to maintain needed visibility.
# ** Note: (vsim-12126) Error and warning message counts have been restored: Errors=0, Warnings=1.
# ** Note: (vsim-8785) UVM-aware debugging capabilities will be disabled since no compiled "questa_uvm_pkg" can be found.
# This also means that later if you turn on UVM-aware debugging your debug simulations may have
# different random seeds from your non-debug simulations.
